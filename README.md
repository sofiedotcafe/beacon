Locate and track Apple Airtags® with ease, regardless of the platform you are using.

## Overview

Beacon is a simple, elegant app and a framework built to integrate with Apple’s Find My® network. It allows you to track existing AirTags® and provides a foundation to make other Bluetooth®-capable devices Find My®-compatible.

The project builds upon the functionality of [OpenHaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack) and the authentication mechanisms of [Macless-Haystack](https://github.com/dchristl/macless-haystack). The entire codebase has been rewritten in Rust to improve performance and maintainability making it possible to leverage [Crux](https://github.com/redbadger/crux) to deliver a seamless, platform-native user experience across multiple platforms, including Android.
